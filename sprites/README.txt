DUMBFPS Sprite Templates (.ans)
--------------------------------
- Run the toolkit to create `sprites/<id>.ans` (80 columns, CP437 art).
- Edit the ANSI file in your favourite CP437 editor (PabloDraw, Moebius, TheDraw).
- Art boxes (left) are where you paint the creature; mask boxes (right) take `1`/`0`.
- Leave the metadata lines and borders in place.
- When youâ€™re ready to use it in-game, SAVE or EXPORT the final art as a `.bin`.
